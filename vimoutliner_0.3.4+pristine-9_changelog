  * Drop .py suffix from menu invocations; thanks to David Nusinow
    (closes: #308073).

  * Add patch to make plugin actually work in global runtime path which was
    hidden in changes to the upstream tarball (urg!)
  * Add examples, which had been hidden in the modified upstream tarball
    to debian/contrib. 
  * Add a patch to fix color names
  * Add a README.source to document patch handling
